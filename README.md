# Analysis_book_for_CHX_NSLSII
All Python tools developed to do the data analysis on CHX beamline at NSLSII
Keywords: GISAXS, XPCS, linear theory analysis, AFM image analysis 
 
1. Visualizations for the GISAXS data and intensity vs time plotting
2. Linear theory analysis
3. XPCS: g2 functions, two-time correlation function, fitting with the KWW form
4. Speckle tracking and cross correlation
5. vibration correction (by speckle tracking), which is only plausible for specific sample movement during data taking
6. AFM image analysis and overlapping calculated structure factor over X-ray data
7. generating movies of the GISAXS data
